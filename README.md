PawPal was developed as a group project by four students during a five-day sprint at Le Wagon Tokyo's Web Development Coding Bootcamp.

PawPal is a Rails-based application inspired by the Airbnb model, using a two-sided marketplace model where pet sitters/pet owners can create listings and make reservations. It leverages key Rails features such as MVC structure, ActiveRecord associations, user authentication (Devise), and database-backed transactions.

PawPal is currently hosted and live on Heroku: https://pawpal-bae480293655.herokuapp.com

For a quick demonstration purpose, you can log in to the app using the following credentials:

📧Email: user@example.com<br>
🔑Password: password

⚠️Note: This app is hosted on Heroku using an Eco Dynos plan, which enters sleep mode after a period of inactivity. As a result, the first request after inactivity may take up to a minute to load.

Thank you!
